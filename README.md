SR1 Java implementation
======

The Symmetric Rank 1 (SR1) method is a quasi-Newton method to update the second derivative (Hessian) based on 
the derivatives (gradients) calculated at two points. It is a generalization to the secant method for a 
multidimensional problem. This update maintains the symmetry of the matrix but does not guarantee that the update 
be positive definite.
